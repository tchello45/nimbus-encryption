# Security Guidelines

> **Security is our foundation.** This document establishes comprehensive security practices for the Nimbus encryption library, emphasizing elegance, clarity, and uncompromising cryptographic security.

## Core Principles

- **Zero tolerance** for security vulnerabilities
- **Minimal attack surface** through careful dependency management
- **Constant-time operations** for all cryptographic functions
- **Memory safety** with automatic secret zeroization
- **Transparent security** through comprehensive testing and auditing

## Dependencies & Supply Chain

### Approved Cryptographic Libraries

Only audited, well-maintained crates are permitted.

### Dependency Rules

- **✅ Required**: Exact version pinning (no `^`, `~`, or `*`)
- **✅ Required**: `cargo audit` passes before any integration
- **✅ Required**: `cargo vet` verification for supply chain security
- **⚠️ Forbidden**: Wildcards, ranges, or unaudited dependencies

### Monitoring & Updates

- **Daily**: Automated vulnerability scanning in CI/CD
- **Weekly**: Dependency update review
- **Critical patches**: Applied within 24 hours
- **Quarterly**: Full dependency audit and cleanup

## Secure Development

### Code Standards

```rust
// ✅ Required: Forbid unsafe code except in designated modules
#![forbid(unsafe_code)]

// ✅ Required: Proper secret handling
use zeroize::{Zeroize, ZeroizeOnDrop};

#[derive(Zeroize, ZeroizeOnDrop)]
struct SecretKey([u8; 32]);

// ✅ Required: Safe error handling (no sensitive data in errors)
#[derive(Debug)]
pub enum CryptoError {
    InvalidInput,
    AuthenticationFailed,
    OperationFailed,
}
```

### Memory Safety Requirements

- **All secrets** must use `zeroize` for automatic clearing
- **Constant-time operations** for all cryptographic comparisons
- **Minimal unsafe code** with explicit security justification
- **Input validation** at all API boundaries

## Testing Framework

We use `cargo nextest` for enhanced testing capabilities:

```bash
# Install testing tools
cargo install cargo-nextest cargo-llvm-cov cargo-audit cargo-vet --locked

# Security test commands
cargo sec-test                      # All tests
cargo sec-cov                       # With coverage
cargo sec-test-release              # Performance validation
```

### Test Requirements

- **95% code coverage** minimum for cryptographic modules
- **Constant-time verification** for sensitive operations

## Code Review Process

### Manual Review Checklist

**Critical Security Checks:**

- [ ] **Signed commits** (all commits cryptographically signed)
- [ ] **No hardcoded secrets** (keys, passwords, tokens)
- [ ] **Approved dependencies** (exact versions, audited crates)
- [ ] **Memory safety** (proper zeroization, minimal unsafe)
- [ ] **Error safety** (no sensitive data in error messages)
- [ ] **Input validation** (all API boundaries protected)
- [ ] **Cryptographic compliance** (approved algorithms only)

### Pre-Review Commands

```bash
# Verify security requirements
git log --show-signature -5         # Check commit signatures
cargo deps-audit                    # Security audit
cargo deps-vet                      # Supply chain verification
cargo sec-check                     # Linting
cargo sec-test                      # Run all tests
```

## Cryptographic Standards

### Forbidden Practices

- ❌ Custom cryptographic implementations
- ❌ Deprecated algorithms (MD5, SHA-1, DES)
- ❌ Predictable randomness sources
- ❌ Key/nonce/salt reuse
- ❌ Plaintext secret storage

## Vulnerability Management

### Process

1. **Detection** → Automated scanning + manual review
2. **Assessment** → Severity classification
3. **Response** → Immediate action for critical issues
4. **Testing** → Comprehensive fix verification
5. **Communication** → Transparent disclosure

## Build & Release Security

### Requirements

- **Reproducible builds** with deterministic outputs
- **Signed releases** with verified cryptographic signatures
- **Isolated build environments** to prevent tampering

### WebAssembly Security

- Enable all available WASM security features
- Minimize API surface area
- Validate all boundary-crossing data
- Use WASI restrictions where applicable

## Compliance & Monitoring

### Regular Audits

- **Quarterly**: Internal security review
- **Annually**: External security audit
- **As-needed**: Focused audits for major changes

### Security Metrics

We track and monitor:

- Dependency vulnerability counts
- Test coverage percentages

## Enforcement

These guidelines are **mandatory** for all contributors. Non-compliance results in:

1. **Immediate code review rejection**
2. **Required fixes before re-review**
3. **Escalation to security team for repeated violations**

> **Remember**: In cryptographic software, every detail matters. When in doubt, prioritize security over convenience and escalate to the security team.
