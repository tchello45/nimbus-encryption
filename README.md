# Nimbus Core

The core for a modular end-to-end encryption toolkit for the web, built in Rust.

## Overview

Nimbus addresses the growing need for secure, and easy-to-use end to end encryption. While most applications rely on server-side security mechanisms, Nimbus empowers developers to implement robust end-to-end encryption directly in the browser, ensuring that sensitive data is encrypted on the sender's device and can only be decrypted by the intended recipient.
