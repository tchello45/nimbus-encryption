# Nimbus Core

The core for a modular end-to-end encryption toolkit for the web, built in Rust.

## Overview

Nimbus addresses the growing need for secure and easy-to-use end-to-end encryption. While most applications rely on server-side security mechanisms, Nimbus empowers developers to implement robust end-to-end encryption directly in the browser, ensuring that sensitive data is encrypted on the sender's device and can only be decrypted by the intended recipient.

## Installation

### Install the Rust toolchain

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

_Visit the [official Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) for more installation methods._

### Clone the repository
